### Notr - Personal notes app

Personal notes app to learn something new

---

#### Why?

I have been itching to learn new things in Javascript/React recently and I feel this is a good personal project

#### Ideas

- The general idea is to create all my own components and styles
- I would also like to create my own WYSIWYG editor for the notes taking section
- I am hoping to keep dependencies at a minimum and would like to see how far I can get without bringing in massive libraries
- The idea is to create an express server with graphql as a separate application that'll save notes as Github issues

##### Contribute

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SiddharthMantri/notr.git
cd notr
npm install
npm run dev
```
